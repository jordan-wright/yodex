# Fact or Fib

Goal: Decide whether a statement is true or false.

How it works:
- The host presents 5 statements, one at a time, using explicit numbering.
- After each statement, the host asks one decision question: "Fact or fib?"
- The listener decides if it is a fact or a fib.
- The host reveals the correct answer immediately after each listener pause.
- The host explains why in one or two simple sentences.
- All facts and fibs must be kid appropriate.

Guidelines:
- Facts should be surprising but understandable.
- Explanations should be clear and encouraging.
- No trick questions meant to confuse.
- Keep each statement short (one sentence when possible).
- Use this fixed item format:
  - "Here's the first statement: ..."
  - "Fact or fib? [short pause]"
  - "That statement was a... Fact/Fib! <short explanation>"
- Continue with:
  - "Here's the second statement: ..."
  - "Here's the third statement: ..."
  - "Here's the fourth statement: ..."
  - "Here's the fifth statement: ..."
- Do not add a second decision question or a second pause in the same item.
