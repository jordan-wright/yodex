# Fact or Fib

Goal: Decide whether a statement is true or false.

How it works:
- The host presents a statement.
- The listener decides if it is a fact or a fib.
- The host reveals the correct answer.
- The host explains why in one or two simple sentences.
- All facts and fibs must be kid appropriate.

Guidelines:
- Facts should be surprising but understandable.
- Explanations should be clear and encouraging.
- No trick questions meant to confuse.
