# Fact or Fib

Goal: Decide whether a statement is true or false.

How it works:
- The host presents 5 statements, one at a time.
- After each statement, the listener decides if it is a fact or a fib.
- The host reveals the correct answer after each statement.
- The host explains why in one or two simple sentences.
- All facts and fibs must be kid appropriate.

Guidelines:
- Facts should be surprising but understandable.
- Explanations should be clear and encouraging.
- No trick questions meant to confuse.
- Keep each statement short (one sentence when possible).
- Use [short pause] after each statement unless it invites imagination or reflection.
