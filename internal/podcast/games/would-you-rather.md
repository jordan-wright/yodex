# Would You Rather

Goal: Choose between two imaginative options and think about why.

How it works:
- The host presents two different choices.
- Neither choice is better or correct.
- The listener picks the one they like more.
- The host reacts positively to the listener's choice.
- The host briefly explores what life would be like with each option.
- All options must be kid appropriate.

Guidelines:
- Keep scenarios playful and age-appropriate.
- Avoid scary or stressful outcomes.
- Encourage imagination and curiosity.
- There is no right or wrong answer. If the host mentions a preference, frame it as their personal pick.
- Use this fixed structure for consistency:
  - "Here's your would-you-rather:"
  - "Option A: ..."
  - "Or Option B: ..."
  - "Which one would you pick? [long pause]"
  - React with a generic affirmation that does not assume a specific choice.
  - Explore A briefly, then explore B briefly.
