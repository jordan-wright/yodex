# Build-It Brainstorm

Goal: Invent a creative solution or invention to a fun problem.

How it works:
- The host presents a playful challenge or problem.
- The listener imagines how they would solve it or what they would invent.
- The host invites the listener to think of features or ideas.
- The host responds enthusiastically to the imagined solution.
- The host shares one possible example solution at the end.

Guidelines:
- Problems should be imaginative but understandable.
- Encourage creativity over correctness.
- Avoid real danger or fear-based scenarios.
- Celebrate originality and effort.
- There is no right or wrong answer. Focus on enthusiastically affirming the listener's idea.
- If the host shares a personal example, keep it very short and clearly label it as their own idea.
