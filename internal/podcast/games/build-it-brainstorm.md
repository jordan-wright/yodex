# Build-It Brainstorm

Goal: Invent a creative solution or invention to a fun problem.

How it works:
- The host presents a playful challenge or problem.
- The listener imagines how they would solve it or what they would invent.
- The host invites the listener to think of features or ideas.
- The host responds enthusiastically to the imagined solution.
- The host shares one possible example solution at the end.

Guidelines:
- Problems should be imaginative but understandable.
- Encourage creativity over correctness.
- Avoid real danger or fear-based scenarios.
- Celebrate originality and effort.
- There is no right or wrong answer. Focus on enthusiastically affirming the listener's idea.
- If the host shares a personal example, keep it very short and clearly label it as their own idea.
- Ask one question at a time. If you ask multiple questions, split them into separate sentences and include a pause after each question.
- Use this fixed structure for consistency:
  - "Today's challenge: ..."
  - "First question: ... [long pause]"
  - Generic affirmation.
  - "Second question: ... [long pause]"
  - Generic affirmation.
  - Optional "Third question: ... [long pause]" for one extra detail.
  - "My quick example (just my idea): ..."
  - End with one short encouragement line.
